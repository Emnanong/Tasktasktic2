    <p>&emsp;My name is  Emmy Nanong, and I am a student at Delaware County Community College. This project is one of the projects for the UX Design class (IMM 200). Unfortunately, due to my busy student life and constantly on the go, sometimes I leave out small tasks I was supposed to do. Writing it down is one of the strategies that help, but sometimes writing, I need to remember where my note is. It would be suitable for busy people like me to have a website that reminds me of everything I must do. Therefore, I make this website simple and easy to use. I will gain more knowledge and develop a better version of it in the future.
